#suppose we have a column (in reality we don't have that dataset with us) where there is date of journey written as
# DD/MM/YYYY, then to make it usedul we will separate out the part of it
# df['Date'] = df['Date_of_Journey'].str.split('/').str[0]
# df['Month'] = df['Date_of_Journey'].str.split('/').str[1]
# df['Year'] = df['Date_of_Journey'].str.split('/').str[2]

# But the above created columns - Date, month, year are in object (can be seen with df.info())
# So, to convert them into integer we will use
# df['Date'] = df['Date'].astype(int)
# df['Month'] = df['Month'].astype(int)
# df['Year'] = df['Year'].astype(int)

# now dropping that imaginary column
# df.drop('Date_of_Journey', axis=1, inplace=True)

# now suppose we have one column named Arrival_hour where the data is in he form xx:xx [some have month too], then to make that useful we will use
# df['Arrival_hour'] = df['Arrival_Time'].str.split(':').str[0]
# df['Arrival_min'] = df['Arrival_Time'].str.split(':').str[1]
